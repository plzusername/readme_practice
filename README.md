# Basic ReadMe markup practice

## Text styles:

The ~~words~~ *text* in ***this example*** has a <sub>SubText</sub> peice and a <sup> SupText</sup> peice

Indeed it has been quoted by **Nelson Mandela** that :
>'A man who uses github markup language to make his repo look nice can get thrice the job oppurtunities than a person who does not'

I see now I see, you just want me to get to the code already, fine by me, but you wont understand a snippet without my further explanation, so here you go:

```javascript
// program to trim a string

function trimString(x) {

    const result = x.replace(/\s/g,'');
    return result

}

const result = trimString('    Hello World    ');
console.log(result);
```

Baffled are you, head over to [The odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) for an explanation on all this javascript nonsense!
